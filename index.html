                <h4>The sight of red roses and heart-shaped boxes of chocolate in the stores reminds me that Valentine's Day is here once again. Though the holiday may seem clichÃ© to some, for me it's a perfect opportunity to express how deeply I care for you.

You are truly the most wonderful partner I could have ever hoped for. Your kindness, humor, strength and compassion amaze me every single day. Thank you, baby ^^ because you have made my life so much richer and more meaningful.

On this Valentine's Day, I want you to know how lucky I feel to call you as my one and only baby ^^. You make me smile with your playful spirit. You fill me with warmth and security with your devoted love. My heart beats only for you and you only bebeee :>>.

I cherish the love we share together. No box of chocolates or bouquet of flowers could ever compare to the treasure of your heart which you've so generously given me. You are my everything, bubba!

HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY, MY LOVE!!! I look forward to celebrating many more of these special days by your side! ^^.</h4>
                <h3>Your Always, <br>Iannie ^^ </h3>
